# Socials App

Welcome to the Backend Engineer Assessment! In this assessment, you will be tasked
with building a RESTful API for a basic social media platform. The API will facilitate user
interactions and data management within the platform.

## Project Setup Instructions

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Timmy-Edibo/thco_tasks.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd thco_tasks.git


3. Install dependencies::
    ```bash
    npm install



4. Build the TypeScript files:
    ```bash
    npm run build


Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies:

Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types
Other necessary dependencies are listed in the package.json file.
How to Run the API
Once the project is set up, you can start the server by running:
    ```bash
    npm start


This will start the Express server, and the API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

For development purposes, you can run the following command which will start the server with auto-reload enabled:
    ```bash
        npm run dev


API Documentation
The API documentation will be available at http://localhost:3000/api-docs once the server is running.
